i have been a student my self so i understand students and the role of being a mentor, If a student is struggling, i know my first priority would be to understand why they are struggling. I would work with them to identify any areas where they are having difficulty, and provide personalized guidance and support to help them get back on track. I would also work with the student to set achievable goals and create a plan for how they can catch up and move forward.
