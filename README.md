# HyperionDev Freelance Code Reviewer Take-Home Test

### About
The purpose of this repository is to showcase my skills as a developer by completing the tasks assigned in [The HyperionDev Freelance Code Reviewer Take-Home Test](https://github.com/hyperiondev-com/THT).

## Code Review Task

The Code Review task involves reviewing a hypothetical student's code submission for correctness, efficiency, style, and documentation. The task I chose to complete is the Python Task, where I was asked to group anagrams in an array of strings. I completed this task in a file called `anagram.py`.

## Code Challenge Task

The Code Challenge task involves solving a programming problem and including a test suite for the solution. I chose to complete Option 1: Say the Number, which involves converting a given number into spoken words. I implemented my solution in Python and included a test suite. I also included all necessary instructions and scripts to build, test, and run my solution on Linux, macOS, and Windows operating systems. I also included a Markdown report that specifies and justifies the worst-case space complexity of my solution.

Overall, this repository serves as a demonstration of my skills as a developer, particularly in Python.
