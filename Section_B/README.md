The following projects are among my favorite projects that I have worked on, although they were collaborative projects. To me, they showcase how far I have come with coding and the experience I gained working with real data. Please bear with me as I take you through each project:

[Project 1](https://github.com/CaitMc/Team_ES2_Unsupervised_Predict): Movie recommender system
This project was a kaggle competition called [EDSA Movie Recommendation Predict](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/edsa-movie-recommendation-predict/overview)were tasked with constructing a recommendation algorithm based on content or collaborative filtering, capable of accurately predicting how a user will rate a movie they have not yet viewed based on their historical preferences. I built a model that achieved a good RMSE score and positioned us fourth on the leaderboard.

[Project 2](https://github.com/CaitMc/unsupervised-predict-streamlit-template): Movie Recommender app
This is my best work. I created the Streamlit app with the help of my team leader to showcase the model we built and how our recommender actually worked. I had fun and was the technical leader in this project, so I handled the technical aspects of the project, which involved coding.

[Project 3](https://github.com/LPTsilo/classification-predict-streamlit-template): Twitter sentiment Analyzer
This Streamlit app was used to analyze Twitter sentiments regarding climate change.
