# Section D: Mentorship
The PDF answers two of the questions on Section D and ill be sharing my personal experiance as well

## Option 1: Student Progress
As a mentor, you are invested in every studentâ€™s progress, as well as
responsible for ensuring high task completion and graduation rates for our
bootcamps.
In the following hypothetical situation, you have 20 part-time students on
a 6-month bootcamp. Of this group, 5 students are 2 weeks behind on
their expected progress in the bootcamp, 10 are at risk of falling behind (if
they do not complete their next task in the next 2 days, they will be behind)
and 5 are ahead of expected progress. Please lay out an intervention plan
to get the 5 lagging students back on track whilst ensuring that the 10
at-risk students do not fall behind and the 5 students that are ahead are
not negatively impacted.

## Option 3: Student Feedback
Handling student concerns is an important part of the mentorship role.
In the following scenario, you have provided feedback to a student in a
code review for one of their submissions. After reading the feedback, the
student responds in an irate manner claiming that you have provided
feedback that does not provide any value, is generic and seems like you
copy-pasted feedback just to complete the review. You did in fact provide
non-generic, personalised and actionable feedback. On top of this, the
student has also made a complaint on social media about the poor quality
of your review. Please explain how you would handle this situation.
